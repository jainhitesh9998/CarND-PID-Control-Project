## Reflections


**PID Controller**

A proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller) is a control loop feedback mechanism.  PID controller consists of three basic coefficients: proportional, integral and derivative which are tuned to get optimal response.

The goals of this project are the following:

* Implement a PID controller in C++.
* Tune the hyper-parameters for the same to successfully run the car on the simulator 

### Effects of P,I,D parameters.
*  P stands for Proportional Gain coefficient. P is proportional to the cte . The steering angle can be calculated by multiplying -Kp with the cte. The major inconvenience withj using only P parameter is the oscillating movement of the car.
* D stands for differential gain, this parameter is the derivative of the cte, for this project D is calculated as (prev_cte - current_cte)  / (delta_t) with delta_t  taken 1.  D dampens the oscillation which occurs due to only using P parameter, thus resulting in a smoother motion.
*  I stands for Integral Gain. This parameter is used to remove the residual cte left in the system , It also removes bias if it exists in  the system. 

` total error = - p_error * Kp - i_error * Ki - d_error * Kd  `

## Parameter Tuning
I used manual approach for parameter tuning, as twiddle was taking long time to give results. I Started the parameter tuning with P, after achieving sufficiently satisfactory result, I tuned D parameter and then the I parameter.

The final values I came up with this approach are 
```
  double d_Kp = 0.28;
  double d_Ki = 0.0002;
  double d_Kd = 4.1;
  throttle = 0.3;
```

    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
